    "For this assignment, we worked on collecting data from social media(Twitter) to complement our already existing data on flights, airports and airlines. Additionally, we also converted our previous database to NoSQL by connecting to a MongoDB server. Fr the first part of the assignment, we used the Twitter API to collect data on various topics related to our domain, including tweets about American Airlines (thing), Logan Airport (place), and pilots (people). We used Python to analyze this tweet data and determine what tags were most popular and trending within our domain. For the second half of the assignment, we imported our old data from Assignments 1 and 2, and along with our newly-collected twitter data, we converted everything into a NoSQL database. By connecting to a MongoDB server, we were also able to test and make sure some of database usecases worked and could provide information requested by the user."

    "The primary focus of this assignment was learning how to analyze social media data, as well as convert a SQL/relational database into a NoSQL database (MongoDB, specifically). We expanded upon our database from Assignment 2 by adding twitter data to it, and analyzing it in order to answer questions about popular topic within our domain. We then converted our database into MongoDB by first denormalizing it, and then establishing a connection with a MongoDB server and transfering over our data."
